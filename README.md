## Data Visualization

![Graph 1](images/table1.png)

*Figure 1: This graph shows the frequency of use of payment methods in the dataset. Each slice represents a payment method. The size of the slice indicates how often that payment method appears in the dataset.*

*Figure 2: When you look at the chart, you can see how many products are in which category. For example, you can see a higher column showing that there are more products in the category “Electronics”. You can also see the total number of products in each category by the numbers above the columns.*

*This chart gives you a quick overview of the distribution of product categories in the dataset. It can be used to see which categories are more concentrated or contain fewer products.*

*Figure 3: When we examine the chart, we see a bar chart showing the number of products sold for each size. In the graph, the x-axis represents the 'Size' values and the y-axis represents the number of products sold for each size. The different colored bars for each size indicate the number of products sold for that size.*

*When we examine the graph, we see that 'Medium' size products are sold the most. While 'Large' size products are also very popular, we observe that 'Small' and 'Extra Large' size products have lower sales.*

*This graph gives us information to compare the sales performance of products in different sizes and to determine which sizes are more popular.*
